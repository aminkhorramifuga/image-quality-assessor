# Image Quality Assessor

Image Quality Assessor is a full-stack application designed to assess the quality of an uploaded image based on various parameters like contrast, saturation, sharpness, and more. The front-end is built with Next.js, and the back-end uses Python with libraries like OpenCV for image processing tasks.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly way to evaluate the quality of an image. This is done by analyzing various image properties using both simple image processing techniques and more advanced machine learning methods.

The general flow of the application is as follows:

1. The user uploads an image through the front-end interface, which is built with Next.js.

2. The uploaded image is sent to the back-end service, which is written in Python.

3. The back-end service performs various quality checks on the image:

    - First, basic checks like resolution and file format are performed.

    - Next, the image contrast is calculated using the standard deviation of pixel intensities in the image. This provides a basic measure of contrast, but might not work perfectly for all images.

    - Finally, more advanced quality checks are performed using machine learning. These checks might include evaluating the sharpness, saturation, and other complex properties of the image. The specific techniques used for these checks will depend on the requirements of the application and might involve training custom machine learning models, using pre-trained models, or other advanced image processing techniques.

4. Once all quality checks are complete, the back-end service responds with a quality report. This report includes the results of each check and an overall quality score.

5. The front-end displays the quality report to the user.
