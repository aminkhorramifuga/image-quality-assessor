Once we have calculated various quality measures for the images (like contrast, sharpness, saturation, etc.), we need to combine these measures into a single quality score. This can be done in many ways, depending on our specific requirements.

For example, we could simply take the average of all quality measures. However, this assumes that all measures are equally important, which might not be true. We could also assign weights to each measure based on their importance, and calculate a weighted average.

Alternatively, we could use machine learning to calculate the quality score. This would involve training a model on a dataset of images with known quality scores, with the quality measures as features and the quality score as the target. This model could then predict the quality score of new images based on their quality measures.
