Sharpness: This measures how clear and detailed an image is. It can be calculated in many ways, but one common method is to use the Laplacian variance. High variance indicates high sharpness.

Saturation: This measures the intensity of colors in an image. It can be calculated by converting the image to the HSV color space and calculating the standard deviation of the S (saturation) channel.

Noise: This measures the amount of random variation in an image. It can be calculated by subtracting a smoothed version of the image from the original image, and calculating the standard deviation of the result.

Composition: This involves more complex aspects of the image like the rule of thirds, depth of field, etc. These can be harder to calculate algorithmically, but might be possible with advanced machine learning techniques.
