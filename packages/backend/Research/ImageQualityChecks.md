Resolution: The image should be of high resolution and not pixelated or blurry. Lower resolution images often look unprofessional and could be off-putting to listeners.

width, height = image.size
resolution = width * height

Brightness and Contrast: The image should have a balanced brightness and contrast to ensure that all elements in the image are clearly visible and not washed out or too dark.

gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
brightness = np.mean(gray_image)
contrast = np.std(gray_image)

Color Balance: The colors used in the image should be well balanced and harmonious.

mean_b, mean_g, mean_r = np.mean(image, axis=(0, 1))
std_b, std_g, std_r = np.std(image, axis=(0, 1))

Noise Level: The image should not have too much noise (random variations of brightness or color information).

blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (5, 5), 0)
noise = np.std(image - blurred)

Composition: The arrangement of elements within a scene. Good composition can make an image more compelling or easier to understand.

Sharpness: The clarity of detail in an image.

laplacian = cv2.Laplacian(image, cv2.CV_64F)
sharpness = np.var(laplacian)
