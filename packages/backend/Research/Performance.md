One way to improve performance is to resize images before processing them. This can reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed, and can speed up many image processing operations.

Another way to improve performance is to use efficient algorithms and libraries. For example, OpenCV is a highly optimized library for image processing, and can perform many operations much faster than pure Python code.
